# Adobe_Bridge_Show_Geo_Location
Adobe Bridge CC startup-script.
Adds an option to Adobe Bridge photo context menus, to see the photo's geo-position on Google Maps.
Opens Google Maps in Firefox webbrowser. I wasn't able to get it to work specifying only URI in cmd.
You might want/need to experiment with how cmd is defined, including adjusting path to your webbrowser's location.

Tested in Adobe Bridge v8.1.
