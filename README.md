# Adobe_Bridge_Show_Geo_Location

Adobe Bridge CC startup-script.

Adds an option to photo context menus in Adobe Bridge CC, to see the photo's geo-position on Google Maps.

You might want/need to experiment with how _cmd_ is defined. Mac users should probably replace _start "" "url"_ with _open "url"_... 

To install, simply copy the jsx file into Adobe Bridge's Startup Scripts folder before opening Bridge. To find this folder's location, open Bridge and choose: Preferences -> Startup Scripts -> Reveal My Startup Scripts.

Tested with Adobe Bridge CC v8.1 (Photoshop CC 2018) and v9.0 (Photoshop CC 2019) on Windows 10.

Inspired by an old script by Paul-Riggot which unfortunately stopped working in modern Photoshop/Bridge CC versions:
